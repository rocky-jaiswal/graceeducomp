    <p>We are delighted to introduce you to Grace Educomp, where our motto is to move beyond text book education. Grace Educomp runs a dynamic book distribution programme that aims to bring out innovative titles from an array of publishers. Grace Educomp works closely with teachers, parents and students to encourage reading and promote the highest quality of reading material in schools. School Programme, which is highly beneficial in enhancing the reading, writing and overall language development of the students, is our key area of focus.. Please find a brief description of few of our most beneficial activities:</p>
<h4>Book of the month</h4>
<p>This is a wonderful activity we promote to enhance the reading skills of the students. Every month, the students of each grade will be given an age appropriate book, especially the “must read”, award winning books introducing them to the world of books, authors and reading! And even before they realize, with very little effort, they will have their own library built at home with the best books available!</p>

<h4>Book Review Sessions</h4>
<p>This activity is aimed at middle school and high school students, which includes providing age appropriate books to read and getting them reviewed. We will co-ordinate with the concerned person at your school in selecting and providing the books. After reading the books, students would be doing a self review on that book which will be supervised by the teachers. If the author of the book is locally available and if the school is willing to spend to provide an opportunity to their students, we make it happen by arranging a session with their favorite author!!!</p>

<h4>Book Clubs and Book Fairs</h4>
  <p>Grace Educomp provides all assistance to school in setting up of Book Clubs which then can help school to organize various literary activities including providing on demand age appropriate books to children. Book Fairs that are mainly organized during special events provide exciting opportunities for students and teachers to acquaint themselves with some of the latest books in a variety of genres. Having a Fair during the school PTM or any other open day when parents come to visit is a great way of letting parents select age-appropriate books for their children. Having a Book Fair during Book week is a great way of complementing school’s literary activities.</p>

<h4>Workshops</h4>
  <p>We can also conduct Workshops for students, teachers and parents, if the school so desires. It includes variety of topics like Leadership, Parenting, Reading, Creative writing, Music, Art etc. It can be done by itself or as a part of other related occasion at the school like ‘Book Week’ ‘Book Carnival’, Teacher’s day, Children’s day etc
  We also organize Story telling sessions for younger kids, Summer Music camps and any other related activities as desired by the school.</p>

<p>When you consider next your arrangements for such products and services, as listed above, we would welcome the opportunity to understand your requirements better. If you have questions, please contact us at numbers provided.</p>
